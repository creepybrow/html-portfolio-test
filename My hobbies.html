<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/ShawshankRedemption.jpg" height="500" width="500"/>
<p>This movie had a great plot I never expected. <br />
Very well thought out, and it kept me guessing the whole way. <br />
I actually was stunned with the conclusion. Brilliant writing.</p>
<h3>My favorite quotes</h3>"I have to remind myself that some Birds
<br /> aren't meant to be Caged."(Morgan Freeman)</h3>
<hr /> "Every man has his breaking point"(Morgan Freeman)<br />
"That's Where I want to live the rest of my life-A warm place with no memory."</h3>
<hr />
<h3>Patch Adams</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/Patch adams.jpg" height="500" width="500"/>
<p>This movie was very dear to me. It showed a doctor who <br />
wasn't about the paycheck. He really cared about healing through <br />
more than just medicine. Took the time to use emotions to give patients <br />
less fortunate than he was the time of their life.</p>
<hr />
<h3>My favorite quotes</h3>
<br />"You Treat A disease, You Win, You Lose.<br />
You Treat A Person, I guarantee You, You'll Win<br />
No Matter What Outcome."(patch Adams)<br />
<hr />
"The Purpose of a doctor or any human in general<br />
should not be to simply delay the death of the patient<br/>
but to increase the person's quality of life."(Patch Adams)
<hr/>
<h3>Law Abiding Citizen</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/Law Abiding Citizen.jpg" height="500" width="500"/>
<p>The protagonist shows what everyone I think wants to see in the legal system<br />
    but this time, he becomes the enemy to prove a point, and by my guess<br />
    in the hope people will come to their senses no matter what he uses as an example.</p>
    
    </p>
<h3>My favorite movie quotes</h3>
<hr/ >
"Well how carefully should I tread!? Because apparently,<br />
I just killed two people! And you are about to let me walk right out that door<br />
How misguided are you!? I feed you a couple legal precedents, and there you<br />
go - you jump on it like a &^&* in heat![The judge indignant bangs her gavel repeatedly]<br />
Folks, you all hang out in the smae little club!"(Clyde)<br />
<br />
And every day you let madmen and murderers back on the street!<br />
You're too busy treating the law like it's a f***ing assembly line!

<h2>Anime</h2>
<img src="../assets/images/Baki.jpg"/>
<h2>Baki The Grappler</h2>
<p>Baki the grappler is one of my favorites.</br>
    Having finished it, I thought it was well written.</br>
This anime was about father and son the whole way</br>
Not a typicall domestic dispute.</p>
<hr/>
<hr/>
<img src="../assets/images/Hunter x Hunter.jpg" height="500" width="600"/>
<h2>Hunter X Hunter</h2>
<p>This anime I would watch during a summer break.<br />
It has just the right amout of episodes. Some are too long. It is a seond to DBZ in my opinion.</p>
<hr/>

<img src="../assets/images/Dragon Ball Z.jpg" height="500" width="600"/>
<h2>Dragon Ball Z</h2>
<p>This anime took up a majority of my teenage years. Watching this in my opinion was<br/>
the same feeling every person who goes to see the big football match every year!</p>
<hr/>
<hr/>
<h2>Cartoons</h2>
<img src="../assets/images/The Simpsons.jpg" height="600" width="600"/>
<h2>The Simpsons</h2>
<p>I'll admit, there weren't many things I could do as a kid. I did watch a lot<br/>
of Simpsons with my best friend in sleep overs. Such a funny show<br/>
Some kids will act out shows they love. It was a nice bonding experience during dinner<br/>
I may have lost some sleep after listening to a few lines from it.</p>
<hr/>
<hr/>
<img src="../assets/images/Futurama.jpg" height="600" width="600"/>
<h2>Futurama</h2>
<p>Along with the simpsons, this show was also funny. I could binge watch it all day and night<br/>
It did have some crude humor, but I never acted on it. Some kids in high school amitted this<br/>
was their mind put on tv.</p>
<img src="../assets/images/Chowder.webp" height="600" width="600"/>
<h2>Chowder</h2>
<p>This was such a classic. To me it was the perfect thing to watch during Lunch. Very family<br/>
friendly. The star of the show stuffing his face on the side made the show.</p>
<hr/>
<hr/>
<img src="../assets/images/Ed Edd and Eddy.jpg" height="600" width="600"/>
<h2>Edd Ed & Eddy</h2>
<p>This classic I ended up watching from Elementry school up until now on occassion<br/>
If you never saw the show as a your son or daughter might have, you could guess which kid<br/>
probably got beat up the most. If you guessed the kid in the back, get cracking, but if it's the front<br/>
You know exactly why =)</p>
<img src="../assets/images/Jimmy Neutron.jpg" height="600" width="600"/>
<h2>Jimmy Neutron</h2>
<p>To me this was like a 3d version of Dexter's Labratory except he had friends.<br/>
And No sister to demolish his inventions. Sadly I never finished it, but I saw it mainly through middle school.</p>
<hr/>
<hr/>
<h2>Tv Shows</h2>
<img src="../assets/images/Lost.jpg"/>
<p>I used to watch this with my family during dinner and often before bed. I was a huge gamer but I did shut it off<br/>
to watch it before going back to obsorb myself in my tech life. This adventure was good, but I was disapppointed<br/>
with how it ended. I can only be so upset though. It can always be better, but beggars can't be choosers.</p>
<img src="../assets/images/House M.D..jpg" height="600" width="600"/>
<h2>House M.D.</h2>
<p>Watching this off an on, I loved in my own time. The actor presented before you made me laugh so hard<br/>
I watched it because of him, I'm sure there were woman who have reasons for watching, but I loved how<br/>
this guy presented his role. Very well done. There were times I wondered if there is a single doctor alive<br/>
willing to have the guts this man did with his career. I'm dying of laughter as I write this.</p>
<img src="../assets/images/The Walking Dead.jpg" height="600" width="700"/>
<h2>The Walking Dead</h2>
<p>This one was a different kind of inspiration, The man up front atually reminds me a lot<br/>
if my dad were a sherrif. I don't say it lightly. My dad sticks to what he knows to be right. And with a little makeup<br/>
He could pull it off. Honestly with some of the lines said, I just see myself watching it thinking of him.<br/>
Overall it's the attitude Rick himself carries through the whole series. It doesn't shake. He stays in character. Love it.<br/>
I would say Darly, the man to his left is, but no, I liked Rick overall.</p>
