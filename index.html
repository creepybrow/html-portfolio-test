<p>I want to thank those who have inspired me to pursue my passions. I won't go into much detail, but you'll get to know those who have inspired me and made me into who I am. So, to start off, take a look around. This website will adapt just as quickly as birds need to. =)</p>

<p>This section is about my closest friends. It's something I wasn't even aware of, but I found out about this group my buddies made over time dedicated to me. At least that's what it felt like.</p>
I may make a game or two to try.
